    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), with a concentration
      in Cybersecurity.
      I have a passion for both software development and security, and I’m always eager to learn about
      how technology can be used to protect systems and data. In addition to my technical interests, I’m also deeply
      involved in music.
      I play piano and keys at my local church, and I find that music helps me stay creative and inspired, both in and
      out of my tech work.
      I’m excited to apply my skills in software engineering and cybersecurity to real-world challenges,
      and I look forward to contributing to innovative projects!</p>
